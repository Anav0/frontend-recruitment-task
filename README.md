# Front-end task

Hey there!

Thanks for joining recruitment for Front-end dev @ netguru. We’ve a small task for you!

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/master/sources/hangman.png)

This is simple Hangman game (you can find PSD in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources)). Can you make this stuff work?

Use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as playground (create an account and create new pen, when you’re done send us link to your pen). You can use any different platform if you want, (for example [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com)), but please remember that:
+ your game should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to play)
+ we should be able to take a look at your code :)

### Rules & hints
1. Use real API for fetching random word. You can use [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/words).
2. There should be no folk at game start, game ends once folk earns left foot (see below).

3. You can write your game in pure JS or choose framework of your choice (React, Ember, Angular preferred).
4. At Netguru we use Sass, HAML, ES6 and CoffeeScript.
5. Pay attention to code quality, formating etc.
6. You can find cropped images in images directory, but you don't have to use all of them (CSS power!).

Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ping us!
