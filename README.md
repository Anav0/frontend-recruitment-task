# Front-end task

Hey there!

Thanks for joining recruitment for Front-end dev @ netguru. We’ve a small task for you!

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/master/sources/hangman.png)

This is simple Hangman game (you can find PSD in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources) directory). Can you make this stuff work?

Use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as playground (create an account and create new pen, once you’re done send us link to your work). You can use any different platform if you want, (for example [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com)), but please remember that:
+ your game should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to play)
+ we should be able to take a look at your code :)

### Rules & hints
1. Use real API for fetching random word. [Wordnik](http://developer.wordnik.com/docs.html#!/words) could be great for that.
2. There should be no folk at game beginning. Game ends once folk earns left foot (see diverted flow below).

3. You can write your game in pure JS or use framework of your choice (React, Ember or Angular preferred).
4. Technology stack at Netguru includes Sass, HAML, ES6 and CoffeeScript. Using any of these is a huge plus.
5. Pay attention to code quality, formating, conventions etc.
6. You can find cropped images in images directory, but you don't have to use all of them (CSS power!).
7. Make use of keyboard as controller.
8. Game over screen is available in [sources](https://github.com/netguru/frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/sources) directory.

**Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ping us!**
